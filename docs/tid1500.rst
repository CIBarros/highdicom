The TID1500 Measurement Report Template
=======================================

The TID1500 "Measurement Report" template is a general-purpose template for
communicating measurements and qualitative evaluations derived from one or
more images or regions of images. It is recommended to read the previous page
on `Structured Reports <sr.html>`_ before this page.

*Highdicom* represents the various sub-templates of the TID1500 template as
Python classes. Using these classes will guide you through the process of
creating TID 1500 SRs in a modular and structured way, and will perform various
checks on the inputs you provide.

Overview of TID1500 Content
---------------------------

A diagram of the structure of TID1500 content is shown here:

At the top level, the Measurement Report template
(:class:`highdicom.sr.MeasurementReport`) represents a report containing
various measurements and various metadata about the process through which it
was created.

A measurement report contains one or more Measurement Groups, each
of which applies either to one or more entire images
(:class:`highdicom.sr.MeasurementsAndQualitativeEvaluations`), a 2D image
region of interest
(:class:`highdicom.sr.PlanarROIMeasurementsAndQualitativeEvaluations`), or a 3D
image region of interest
(:class:`VolumetricROIMeasurementsAndQualitativeEvaluations`).

Each Measurement Group contains a number of Measurements (numerical values
derived from an image, such as a length or volume) and/or Qualitative
Evaluations (categorical values derived from an image, such as classification
of a tumor morphology).

When constructing the content, it is necessary to start at the bottom of the
content tree with the Measurements and Evaluations, add them into Measurement
Groups, add these groups to a Measurement Report, and then create the document.
However, here we will describe the structure from the top down, as this makes
the big picture clearer.

Measurement Report
------------------

Every TID1500 Structured Report contains exactly one Measurement Report
at the root of its content tree. This is represented by the class
:class:`highdicom.sr.MeasurementReport`. 

The first ingredient in the Measurement Report is the "Observation Context",
which contains metadata describing the way the observations that led to the
report were made. This includes information such as the person or device that
made the observations, and the subject about which the observations were made:


.. code-block:: python

    import highdicom as hd

    observer_person_context = hd.sr.ObserverContext(
        observer_type=codes.DCM.Person,
        observer_identifying_attributes=hd.sr.PersonObserverIdentifyingAttributes(
            name='Doe^John'
        )
    )
    observer_device_context = hd.sr.ObserverContext(
        observer_type=codes.DCM.Device,
        observer_identifying_attributes=hd.sr.DeviceObserverIdentifyingAttributes(
            uid=hd.UID()
        )
    )
    observation_context = hd.sr.ObservationContext(
        observer_person_context=observer_person_context,
        observer_device_context=observer_device_context,
    )

The second required ingredient is a procedure code describing the procedure
that was performed to result in the observations. Finally, we have the image
measurement groups that the report contains (described below). Combining these
we can construct the Measurement Report, and use it to construct the SR
document:

.. code-block:: python

    import highdicom as hd

    measurement_report = hd.sr.MeasurementReport(
        observation_context=observation_context,  # from above
        procedure_reported=codes.LN.CTUnspecifiedBodyRegion,
        imaging_measurements=[...],
    )

    # Create the Structured Report instance
    sr_dataset = hd.sr.Comprehensive3DSR(
        evidence=[...],  # all datasets referenced in the report
        content=measurement_report,  # TODO fix this
        series_number=1,
        series_instance_uid=hd.UID(),
        sop_instance_uid=hd.UID(),
        instance_number=1,
        manufacturer='Manufacturer'
    )

Measurement Groups
------------------

A Measurement Report contains one or more Measurement Groups. There are three
types of Measurement Groups, corresponding to entire images, 2D regions of
interest, and 3D regions of interest. The three types may be mixed and matched
within a single Measurement Report in any combination.

Common Parameters for Measurement Groups
----------------------------------------

The three types of measurement group are more alike than different. The
following parameters may be used for all Measurement Groups, regardless of
type (some have been omitted for brevity):

- ``tracking_identifier`` (:class:`highdicom.sr.TrackingIdentifier`):
    Identifier for tracking measurements
- ``finding_type`` (:class:`highdicom.sr.CodedConcept`), optional
    Type of observed finding
- ``algorithm_id``: (:class:`highdicom.sr.AlgorithmIdentification`), optional
    Identification of algorithm used for making measurements.
- ``finding_sites``: ``Sequence[``:class:`highdicom.sr.FindingSite` ``]``, optional
    Coded description of one or more anatomic locations at which
    finding was observed
- ``measurements``: ``Sequence[``:class:`highdicom.sr.Measurement` ``]``, optional
    Numeric measurements
- ``qualitative_evaluations``:``Sequence[``:class:`highdicom.sr.CodedConcept` ``]``, optional
    Coded name-value pairs that describe qualitative evaluations
- ``finding_category``: (:class:`highdicom.sr.CodedConcept`), optional
    Category of observed finding, e.g., anatomic structure or
    morphologically abnormal structure

Measurements And Qualitative Evaluations (TID 1501)
---------------------------------------------------

The first, and simplest, type of Measurement Group applies to one or more
entire images (or optionally one or more entire frames in the case of
multiframe source images). This is implemented using
:class:`highdicom.sr.MeasurementsAndQualitativeEvaluations`.

In addition to the common parameters above, this class also accepts a parameter
``source_images``, which is a sequence of
:class:`highdicom.sr.SourceImageForMeasurementGroup` items specifying the
images (or frames) to which the measurement group applies.

The following is a simple example:

Planar ROI Image Measurements (TID 1410)
----------------------------------------

This type of Measurement Group applies to a specific planar sub-region of the
source image or images. This is implemented in the class
:class:`highdicom.sr.PlanarROIMeasurementsAndQualitativeEvaluations`).

This class takes additional parameter specifying the region. There are two
distinct options here:

1. The image region is specified directly in the SR using a
   :class:`highdicom.sr.ImageRegion` or :class:`highdicom.sr.ImageRegion3D`
   passed as the ``referenced_region`` parameter. In this case, the coordinates
   defining the SR are stored within the measurement group itself.
2. The region is specified as a reference to a single slice of a single segment
   stored in a separate DICOM Segmentation Image object, specified by passing a
   :class:`highdicom.sr.ReferencedSegmentationFrame` to the
   `referenced_segment` parameter, which contains UIDs to identify the
   Segmentation Image along with the segment number of the specific segment and
   the frames within which it is stored.

Note that **either** ``referenced_region`` or ``referenced_segment``
should be passed, and not both (or neither).

The choice between :class:`highdicom.sr.ImageRegion` and
:class:`highdicom.sr.ImageRegion3D` determines whether the image region is
defined in 2D image coordinates or 3D frame of reference coordinates. Either
way, the region must be planar. It is possible to store coordinates for a
planar in frame of reference coordinates in an
:class:`highdicom.sr.ImageRegion3D`.

Volumetric ROI Image Measurements (TID 1411)
--------------------------------------------

This type of Measurement Group applies to a specific volumetric sub-region of
the source image or images. This is implemented in the class
:class:`highdicom.sr.VolumetricROIMeasurementsAndQualitativeEvaluations`).

Like the similar Planar ROI class, this class takes additional parameter
specifying the region. In this case there are three options:

1. The image region is specified directly in the SR in image coordinates using
   one or more objects of type :class:`highdicom.sr.ImageRegion` passed as the
   ``referenced_regions`` parameter, representing the volumetric region as set
   of 2D regions across multiple images or frames.
2. The region is specified as a single volumetric region defined in frame of
   reference coordinates using a single :class:`highdicom.sr.VolumeSurface`
   object passed to the ``referenced_volume_surface`` parameter.
3. The region is a reference to an entire segment (which may spread across
   multiple images or frames) of a Segmentation Image object, specified by
   passing a :class:`highdicom.sr.ReferencedSegment` to the
   `referenced_segment` parameter, which contains UIDs to identify the
   Segmentation Image along with the segment number of the specific segment.

Note that exactly one of ``referenced_regions``, ``referenced_volume_surface``,
or ``referenced_segment`` should be passed.
