The TID1500 Measurement Report Template
=======================================

The TID1500 "Measurement Report" template is a general-purpose template for
communicating measurements and qualitative evaluations derived from one or
more images or regions of images. It is recommended to read the previous page
on `Structured Reports <sr.html>`_ before this page.

*Highdicom* represents the various sub-templates of the TID1500 template as
Python classes. Using these classes will guide you through the process of
creating TID 1500 SRs in a modular and structured way, and will perform various
checks on the inputs you provide.

Overview of TID1500 Content
---------------------------

A diagram of the structure of TID1500 content is shown here:

At the top level, the Measurement Report template
(:class:`highdicom.sr.MeasurementReport`) represents a report containing
various measurements and various metadata about the process through which it
was created.

A measurement report contains one or more Measurement Groups, each
of which applies either to one or more entire images
(:class:`highdicom.sr.MeasurementsAndQualitativeEvaluations`), a 2D image
region of interest
(:class:`highdicom.sr.PlanarROIMeasurementsAndQualitativeEvaluations`), or a 3D
image region of interest
(:class:`VolumetricROIMeasurementsAndQualitativeEvaluations`).

Each Measurement Group contains a number of Measurements (numerical values
derived from an image, such as a length or volume) and/or Qualitative
Evaluations (categorical values derived from an image, such as classification
of a tumor morphology).

When constructing the content, it is necessary to start at the bottom of the
content tree with the measurements and evaluations, and gradually compose them
to create the higher-level templates. However, here we will describe the
structure from the top down, as this makes it easier to understand the overall
structure.

Measurement Report
------------------

Every TID1500 Structured Report contains exactly one Measurement Report
at the root of its content tree. This is represented by the class
:class:`highdicom.sr.MeasurementReport`. 

The first ingredient in the Measurement Report is the "Observation Context",
which contains metadata describing the way the observations that led to the
report were made. This includes information such as the person or device that
made the observations, and the subject about which the observations were made:


.. code-block:: python

    import highdicom as hd

    observer_person_context = hd.sr.ObserverContext(
        observer_type=codes.DCM.Person,
        observer_identifying_attributes=hd.sr.PersonObserverIdentifyingAttributes(
            name='Doe^John'
        )
    )
    observer_device_context = hd.sr.ObserverContext(
        observer_type=codes.DCM.Device,
        observer_identifying_attributes=hd.sr.DeviceObserverIdentifyingAttributes(
            uid=hd.UID()
        )
    )
    observation_context = hd.sr.ObservationContext(
        observer_person_context=observer_person_context,
        observer_device_context=observer_device_context,
    )

The second required ingredient is a procedure code describing the procedure
that was performed to result in the observations. Finally, we have the image
measurement groups that the report contains (described below). Combining these
we can construct the Measurement Report, and use it to construct the SR
document:

.. code-block:: python

    import highdicom as hd

    measurement_report = hd.sr.MeasurementReport(
        observation_context=observation_context,  # from above
        procedure_reported=codes.LN.CTUnspecifiedBodyRegion,
        imaging_measurements=[...],
    )

    # Create the Structured Report instance
    sr_dataset = hd.sr.Comprehensive3DSR(
        evidence=[...],  # all datasets referenced in the report
        content=measurement_report,  # TODO fix this
        series_number=1,
        series_instance_uid=hd.UID(),
        sop_instance_uid=hd.UID(),
        instance_number=1,
        manufacturer='Manufacturer'
    )

Measurement Groups
------------------

A Measurement Report contains one or more Measurement Groups. There are three
types of Measurement Groups, corresponding to entire images, 2D regions of
interest, and 3D regions of interest. The three types may be mixed and matched
within a single Measurent Report in any combination.

TID 1501 (:class:`hd.sr.MeasurementsAndQualitativeEvaluations`)
---------------------------------------------------------------

The first, and simplest, type of Measurement Group applies to one or more 
entire images.

TID 1501 Planar ROI Image Measurements (:class:`hd.sr.PlanarROIMeasurementsAndQualitativeEvaluations`)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The first, and simplest, type of Measurement Group applies to one or more 
entire images.
